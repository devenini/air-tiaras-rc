# Air Tiaras Runecraft Plugin
This runecraft method is exclusively used by the F2P-UIM community. The plugin provides an overlay sets displaying the current lap time, the best lap time, laps until goal. The XP drops are so separated from the others that the most accurate way to mesure efficiency is by having the lap time displayed.
