# Air Tiaras Runecraft Plugin
This runecraft method is exclusively used bye the F2P-UIM LVL-3 community. The plugin provides an overlay sets displaying the current lap time, the best lap time, laps until goal, etc.

## Lap
In this method, a lap is a full run before earning runecraft XP. It consists of :
- Entering the crafting guild
- Mining silver ores
- Running to Falador furnace to make tiaras
- Suiciding near the air altar with an NPC
- Claiming air talisman to the Duke in Lumbridge.
- Go back to the air altar and make air tiaras
- Walk to the crafting guild and repeat

The Xp drops are so separated from the others that the most accurate way to mesure efficiency is by having the lap time displayed.

## todo
- Calculate laps per hour
- Enhance valid lap condition
- Clean & optimize plugin code
- Prevent from using in P2P
- Maybe expand the plugin to other F2P-UIM runecraft methods? (earth & body)
